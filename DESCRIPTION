Title: LASSO Regularization in mxModels
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jannik Orzek
Maintainer: <orzekjan@hu-berlin.de>
Description: This package performs LASSO regularization in mxModels 
    creteated with the OpenMx package. I develop the package for my 
    master thesis and it is based on the the regsem - package by 
    Dr. Ross Jacobucci. As laremm is still under development, I 
    recommended to use regsem instead of laremm if you want to 
    perform regularization in Structural Equation Modeling.
